so this is a OpenFOAM natural convection case

the mesh is coarse and the simulation is laminar.

However, the Rayleigh Number exceeds 3e8 which makes it turbulent.
So there will need to be refinements made, nevertheless, it is good for demonstrating a basic use of chtMultiRegionFoam

Also, parallel simulation doesn't work yet...

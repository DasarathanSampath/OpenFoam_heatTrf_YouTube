so this case is unstable. Here's the list of things i tried...


changing delta T to become 1e-3 to make it smaller so initial courant number is not 300-1000

changing maxCo to 15 (don't work)

changing to fineMesh (don't work)

tried to run potentialfoam (but how does this work in multiRegion?

change shell temperature to 293 initial

didn't work


change fvSolution in main fvSolution file system/fvSolution
cos for some reason, i don't get multiple outerCorrectors when solving between regions.

initial velocity field for shell side not done, maybe potentialFoam

potentialFoam -region shell

this command works!

potentialFoam -region shell -initialiseUBCs

now this automatically initialises my velocity BCs for me,

i'll of course need to add in relevant entries into the fvSchemes and fvSolution

potentialFoam doesn't work if i just do this for shell,

one more potential issue is that i didn't write the pressure fields...

now i tried making it solve for p_rgh, but it doesn't work as well because the pressure BCs are not set right 
(calculated)

so when i look at initialised BCs, even that don't work too well, 

next i'll change rho to an initial vlaue of 1000

(doesn't work, almost has no impact)


next suspect, omega tends to give funny resultss.... changing the outlets to zerogradient BCs.

also suspect initial temperatures are too off (ie boundary conditions not correctly done, one boundary is 300K and the boundary next to it is 293K, does that cause problem?)
so i changed all to 293K 

changing omega doesn't work

frankly i don't know what's going on now... So i may try buoyantPimpleFoam first to do for single region


let me do buoyantPimpleFoam for salome first
